<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="candlestick-patterns">Candlestick Patterns</h2>
<p>When first looking into trading, I saw that everyone was talking about <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/092315/5-most-powerful-candlestick-patterns.asp">candlestick patterns</a>. However, I could never wrap my head around how certain patterns could predict the direction of price. To me, it always seemed like astrology. You can’t just look at the formation of stars and say that something will happen in the future.</p>
<p>While candlestick patterns do depict the price action in that time frame, the data can’t be sufficient enough to go off of, right? The best way to see it for ourselves would be to backtest it.</p>
<p>So, that’s what I’m going to do in this blog. I’ll test it out on a year worth of data.</p>
<p>Now, there are dozens of these patterns, and testing every single one of them would be beyond the scope of this blog. Instead, I’ve decided to test out only one kind of such pattern. The <strong>“Engulfing Patterns”</strong>. Mostly because these are quite popular and farnkly the easiest to explain.</p>

<p>The engulfing pattern consists of two candles. One is of the opposite kind of the other. The engulfing pattern is formed when the second candle’s body completely engulfs the preceding candle’s body. Thus the name “engulfing”.</p>
<p>We have two kinds of engulfing patterns. The bullish engulfing pattern and the bearish engulfing pattern. Each supposedly predicts a reversal in their respective directions.</p>

<dt>Bullish Engulfing Pattern</dt>
<dd>
A bullish engulfing pattern is one where the first candle is bearish and the second candle opens lower than the first candle’s close but closes higher than the first candle’s open.
</dd>
<dt>Bearish Engulfing Pattern</dt>
<dd>
A bearish engulfing pattern is one where the first candle is bullish and the second candle opens higher than the first candle’s close but closes lower than the first candle’s open.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The rationale is that when a bullish engulfing pattern appears, the price is supposed to go up, and when a bearish engulfing pattern appears, the price is supposed to go down.</p>

<p>Now let’s get into the testing part. As mentioned before, I want to test it on a year worth of data.

<p>It’s time to define the logic and create the entries and exits. The entries will be when there’s a bullish engulfing pattern, and the exits will be when there’s a bearish one. We won’t go the usual route of going short once there’s a bearish signal. As short selling isn’t possible in DSE.</p>

<p>The entries and exits are defined exactly as explained before. Two opposite candles. The second one’s body completely engulfs the first one’s. Also, the entries and exits are shifted forward by one candle to account for look-forward bias.</p>
<p>Now we will run the test. For this, I’m using a package called <a href="https://github.com/polakowo/vectorbt">vectorbt</a>. This will let us test the whole thing way more efficiently. There is an option to set the commission rate, but I will not set one. Because, we want to see the performance without the effect of settlement delay and commissions. As for the initial capital, I’ll set it to BDT 100k just for the sake of it.</p>

<p>The <code>-3.4%</code> return does look good compared with the buy &amp; hold return of <code>-14.18%</code>. But it’s still in the negative. The win rate of 27% isn’t that compelling either. Because the difference between the average winning trade and the average losing trade isn’t significant enough.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s see how the distribution of the returns looks like.</p>

<p>Just looking at the 381.5% return would be a bad idea. Because this particular stock, “KBPPWBIL” somehow has a buy &amp; hold return of 13x!! Taking that into consideration, 381.5% is actually quite a bad performance. Not to mention, this specific stock is way out of the norm.</p>
